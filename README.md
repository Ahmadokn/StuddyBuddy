# StudyBuddy Demo

Welcome to the StudyBuddy Demo! This is an early version of our web-based academic management tool designed to help students stay organized and collaborate efficiently. Below you'll find an overview of what the application can do so far, what it currently lacks, and our plans for future enhancements.

## Overview

StudyBuddy is a user-friendly application that provides students with a centralized dashboard for managing assignments, tracking study sessions, engaging in group chats, and updating profile information. This demo version highlights the core user interface and basic functionalities, serving as a foundation for our future development.

## Current Features

- **Dashboard:**  
  Displays a quick summary including:

  - Number of assignments due
  - Upcoming study sessions
  - Active group chats

- **Assignments Section:**  
  Lists upcoming assignments along with their due dates.

- **Collaboration Section:**  
  Simulates a group chat environment where users can send messages.  
  _(Note: Currently, this is a static demo and does not support real-time communication.)_

- **Profile Section:**  
  Provides a simple form to update profile information (e.g., name and email).  
  _(Note: Form submissions trigger a demo alert; no actual data persistence is implemented.)_

- **Navigation:**  
  A responsive navigation bar allows smooth switching between the Dashboard, Assignments, Collaboration, and Profile sections.

## What It Lacks

While our demo showcases a solid user interface and basic interactivity, several key features are not yet implemented:

- **Real-Time Data Integration:**  
  The demo does not support dynamic updates or a live database connection.

- **User Authentication:**  
  No secure login or registration system is in place yet.

- **Back-End Functionality:**  
  All features run on the front end; there is currently no back-end API for data storage or retrieval.

- **Enhanced Collaboration Tools:**  
  Real-time chat, file sharing, and more advanced group collaboration features are pending.

- **Personalization and Data Persistence:**  
  The dashboard and profile settings are static and do not reflect personalized or saved user data.

## Future Roadmap

We plan to roll out the following improvements in upcoming releases:

- **User Authentication:**  
  Implement secure login, registration, and session management.

- **Dynamic Back-End Integration:**  
  Connect the application to a database with a server-side API for real-time content updates and persistent user data.

- **Real-Time Collaboration:**  
  Enable real-time messaging and collaboration using WebSockets or similar technologies.

- **Enhanced Profile Management:**  
  Allow users to update and save their profile information, including profile pictures and preferences.

- **Data Analytics Dashboard:**  
  Introduce interactive charts and visualizations to help students track study progress and academic performance.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance StudyBuddy into a fully-featured academic companion platform!
